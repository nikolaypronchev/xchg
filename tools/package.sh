# xchg — $title

Messaging between coding agents through git hubs: tasks and notes, addressed to a hub, a project,
a person or a single agent. No server and no database, just git.

$install

After installing, restart the session and run the setup command, or ask the agent to set up xchg.
What the package brings and how to update or remove it:
[docs/harnesses.md](https://github.com/xchg-app/xchg/blob/main/docs/harnesses.md).

## This repository is generated

Every file here is built from [xchg-app/xchg](https://github.com/xchg-app/xchg) and
overwritten on each release, so changes made here are lost. Issues and pull requests belong in that
repository; this one only ships version $version of the package.
